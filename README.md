# Python
  This is my most recent project in Python and the most accurate example of my experience and competancy in Python. This is a computer-vision program I developed with a team of two others that, given a sample image of an animal's (that has scaly skin) skin, detects and counts the scales on the animal. It was meant to serve as a solution to the issue of human error in manually counting scales for an overarching biological study of Anolis cristatellus lizards. I started off knowing absolutely nothing about computer-vision nor any of the APIs used in this project. 
  I am particularly proud of this project because it represented an opportunity for me to dive into uncharted territory (for myself) and learn something completely new in computer science. In this project, I was able to develop both my team and individual research skills as well as my ability to work in parts of computer science that I am not necessarily experienced in.

# Python
This is my most recent project in Python and the most accurate example of my experience and competancy in Python. I developed it with a team of two others. I started off knowing absolutely nothing about computer-vision nor any of the APIs used in this project. I am particularly proud of this project because it represented an opportunity for me to dive into uncharted territory (for myself) and learn something completely new in computer science. In this project, I was able to develop my team and individual research skills as well as my ability to work in parts of computer science that I am not necessarily experienced in.
